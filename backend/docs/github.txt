Swagger Codegen CLI Docker Image

The Swagger Codegen image acts as a standalone executable. It can be used as an alternative to installing via homebrew, or for developers who are unable to install Java or upgrade the installed version.

To generate code with this image, you'll need to mount a local location as a volume.

Example:

docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/local swaggerapi/swagger-codegen-cli generate \
    -i http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json \
    -l go \
    -o /local/out/go
(On Windows replace ${PWD} with %CD%)

The generated code will be located under ./out/go in the current directory.
